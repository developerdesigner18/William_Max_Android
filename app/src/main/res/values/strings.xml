    <string name="help1">Not happy with the service or product you have received from a company on AFROBIZFIND?</string>

    <string name="help1_solution">\'If you think a business has broken the law or acted unfairly, you can report them to Trading Standards. \nTrading Standards use the information you give them to investigate unfair trading and illegal business activity, like rogue traders and scams.
\nTrading Standards can take businesses to court or stop them operating, but they won’t help you fix your problem - for example, they can’t help you get a refund.
\nYou can get help with your consumer problem from the Citizens Advice consumer service.\'</string>

    <string name="help1_link"><a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/get-more-help/if-you-need-more-help-about-a-consumer-issue/">get help with your consumer problem</a></string>

    <string name="help2">Check what you should report to Trading Standards</string>

    <string name="help2_solution">You should report a business to Trading Standards if they sold you something:
\n•unsafe or dangerous, like an electronic appliance with faulty wiring or food past its use-by date
\n•fake
\n•not as described - for example, you bought a package holiday but something advertised wasn’t included
\n•you didn’t want to buy - for example, they put pressure on you
\nYou can also tell them about a business if:
\n•they scammed you - for example, you paid for something online that you didn’t receive and you couldn’t contact the seller
\n•they tried to stop you using your legal rights - for example, they said you can’t return faulty goods
\n•they weren’t clear about the price or added on extra costs - for example, they advertised theatre ticket prices without booking fees
\n•they sold products to people who looked underage without asking for ID - for example, alcohol, knives or fireworks
\n•they didn’t carry out work properly - for example, kitchen fitters left your home in a dangerous state
        \nReport a business to Trading Standards
       \n To report to Trading Standards, you need to contact the Citizens Advice consumer service.
\nThey will pass your report to Trading Standards and we can also give you advice about your problem. You can:
\n•use our online form - we’ll get back to you within 5 days
\n•get help from an adviser

    <string name="help3">What happens after you\'ve reported to Trading Standards</string>

    <string name="help3_solution">Trading Standards will use the information you give to decide if they’ll investigate. They’ll only contact you if they need more information.
\nEven if Trading Standards don\'t contact you, they might use your evidence to take action against the business in the future. For example, if other people make complaints about the same business.
